(* Solve a synthesis problem.
    `solve_problem (target, reference, repr) functions` solves the synthesis problem
    that consists in implementing the unknowns found in the pmrs named target in the
    functions such that it is equivalent to (reference â—‹ repr).
    If None is passed as first argument, the function looks for PMRS named "target",
    "spec" and "repr" in the `functions` map.
