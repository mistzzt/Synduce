\begin{table}
	\caption{Experimental Results.  Benchmarks are grouped by categories introduced in Section \ref{sec:cstudies}. \# steps indicates the number of refinement rounds. $T_{last}$ is the elapsed time before the last call to the SyGuS solver in the last refinement step before timeout. All times are in seconds. The best time is highlighted in bold font.  A '-' indicates timeout ($>$ 10 min). The ``Inv'' column indicates if codomain constraints were required. Experiments are run on a laptop with 16G memory and an i7-8750H 6-core CPU at 2.20GHz running Ubuntu 19.10.}\label{table:experiments}
